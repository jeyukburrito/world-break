# Webapp Build Status

Last updated: 2026-03-15

## Current Phase: Phase 2 — Core Screens and CRUD

### Phase 0: Project Bootstrap
- [x] Initialize manual Next.js scaffold with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind, App Router
- [x] Install Prisma, Supabase client packages, Recharts
- [x] Set up `.env.local.example`
- [x] Create initial Prisma schema (User, Deck, MatchResult, Tag, MatchResultTag)

### Phase 1: Data and Auth Foundation
- [x] Configure Supabase Auth skeleton with Google login
- [x] Apply RLS SQL — all records scoped by `user_id`
- [x] Add local seed script for development user and sample decks

### Phase 2: Core Screens
- [ ] `/login`
- [ ] `/dashboard`
- [x] `/matches/new`
- [x] `/matches` (history + filters)
- [x] `/matches/[id]/edit`
- [x] `/settings` + `/settings/decks`
- [x] `/settings/games`

Phase 2 note:
- Route skeletons and placeholder UI for all MVP screens have been created under `webapp/app/`.
- Deck management is now connected to Supabase via Prisma on `/settings/decks`.
- Card game category management is now connected on `/settings/games`.
- `/matches/new` now reads the authenticated user's active deck list from the database.
- Decks are now categorized by user-defined card game names.
- Match creation and history listing are now connected to Supabase.
- Match update/delete are now connected to Supabase with owner checks.
- Tag wiring is not connected yet.

### Phase 3: Stats and Export
- [x] Win-rate cards (overall, 7/30 days, first/second, BO1/BO3)
- [x] Matchup and deck-level summary tables
- [x] First-pass dashboard charts (play order, BO format, 30-day trend)
- [x] CSV export from filtered results

### Phase 4: QA and Release
- [ ] Restrict access to approved accounts
- [ ] Seed test dataset
- [x] Production env vars + Vercel deploy
