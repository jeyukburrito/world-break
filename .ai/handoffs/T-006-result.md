# T-006 Result

## Summary
Implemented backend safety fixes defined in `T-006-spec.md` without changing feature scope.

## Files Changed
- `webapp/app/settings/profile/actions.ts`
- `webapp/app/matches/tournaments/end/route.ts`
- `webapp/lib/validation/match.ts`

## Implemented
- Account deletion order fix
  - Changed flow to delete Supabase Auth user first, then delete Prisma user row.
  - On Supabase delete failure, now redirects to `/settings/profile?error=delete_failed` (instead of throwing).
- Match date validation hardening
  - Updated `playedAt` validation from non-empty string to strict `YYYY-MM-DD` regex.
- Tournament end safety check
  - Added `updateMany` result count check.
  - If `count === 0`, now redirects to `/matches?error=tournament_not_found`.
  - Success path remains `/matches?message=tournament_ended`.

## Test Results
- `npm.cmd run lint`: PASS
  - `next lint` reported no warnings/errors.
- `npm.cmd run build`: FAIL
  - Build failed with environment error: `spawn EPERM`.

## Risks
- Production build verification is incomplete due to environment-level `spawn EPERM`.
- `playedAt` format validation now rejects malformed input earlier; this is intended but may surface hidden client-side invalid submissions that previously slipped through.
