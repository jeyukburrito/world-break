# T-003 Result

## Summary
Implemented the UI consistency and accessibility polish items from `T-003-spec.md`.

## Files Changed
- `webapp/components/bottom-nav.tsx`
- `webapp/components/period-filter.tsx`
- `webapp/components/app-shell.tsx`
- `webapp/components/dashboard-charts.tsx`

## Implemented
- Bottom nav
  - Added inline SVG icons for each item
  - Changed label layout to vertical icon + text
  - Reduced label size to `text-xs`
  - Increased tap target height with `py-3.5`
- Period filter
  - Added `aria-pressed` to preset buttons
- App shell header
  - Changed brand text from `<p>` to `<span aria-hidden="true">` for cleaner heading structure
- Dashboard charts
  - Added empty-state CTA linking to `/matches/new`
  - Changed the first legend indicator to use `bg-accent` instead of a hardcoded hex color

## Test Results
- `npm.cmd run lint`: PASS
- `npm.cmd run build`: FAIL
  - Error: `[Error: spawn EPERM]`
  - This appears to be an environment permission issue rather than a code-level build error

## Risks
- Production build validation is still incomplete because `npm run build` could not complete in the current environment.
- T-003 intentionally did not modify T-002-owned files, so final integrated build verification is still needed after both tickets are combined.
